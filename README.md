# Arduino-ESP32

### üìÅ ESP32(TX)-ESP32(RX) Communication
- If TX successfully sends PWM signal (100Hz, 50% duty cycle) its LED turns on.
- If RX successfully receives that signal, it prints out the frequency of that signal on the Serial Monitor. So in this case, `Frequency: 100 Hz` .
- Pin on D2 of TX connected to D15 of RX
- Outcome:
